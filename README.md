EPL â€” Emacs Package Library
===========================

[![License GPL 3][badge-license]][copying]
[![Build Status][badge-travis]][travis]

EPL provides a convenient high-level API for various package.el versions, and
aims to overcome its most striking idiocies.

Installation
------------

Install from [MELPA][] or [Marmalade][].  The former is strongly recommended.

In your [`Cask`][cask]:

```cl
(source gnu)
(source melpa)

(depends-on "epl")
```

Alternatively, users of Debian 9 or later or Ubuntu 16.04 or later may
simply `apt-get install elpa-epl`.

EPL supports GNU Emacs 24 with the built-in `package.el` library.  EPL should
also work on GNU Emacs 23 with the [3rd party `package.el`][legacy-package], but
this combination is not regularly tested anymore.  Other versions of Emacs, and
other flavors of Emacs (e.g. XEmacs, Aquamacs, etc.) are *not*
supported.

Usage
-----

Refer to the commentary of `epl.el` for a list of functions, and to the
docstrings of these functions for usage instructions.

We may add a list of all functions to this README, but this is not exactly
easy.  Pull requests welcome.
